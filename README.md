# Game Sales Analysis

Basic hands-on experience in the Jupyter Notebook environment, focusing on the complete workflow for data analysis and visualization.
Learned to use the Pandas library to import, clean and filter large datasets to meet specific analysis requirements. 
Utilized the Matplotlib library to generate a variety of clear and informative plots (e.g., line, bar, scatter graphs) directly from these filtered subsets, effectively translating raw data and predefined conditions into meaningful visual insight.

Provided me with a small taste of ML.
